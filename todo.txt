- Fix the CCL crash.
- Separate project page and a Git repo for trivial-gray-streams.
- Remove the ENSURE-INITIALIZED function from the public API. 
  It was only intoroduced to provide users access to the RAND-SEEND
  which we decided to pass as a parameter to the ENSURE-INITIALIZED. 
  We did this because solaris users complained, as Solaris doesn't 
  have /dev/random, /dev/urnandom files which OpenSSL uses to initialize 
  it's random number generator. But now we know that on Solaris people can
  use EGD: The Entropy Gathering Daemon: http://egd.sourceforge.net/,
  and OpenSSL uses it if it's running on a systems without /dev/random.
  Therefore we should get rid of the ENSURE-INITIALIZED and just
  put an excerpt from the OpenSSL docs about what software should
  be installed on the systems without /dev/random.
- Fix LispBIO.
